This is my first introduction to the Windows application. I was amazed at how it can help our day-to-day lives such as making a calculator for specific tasks, it is much easier to use it than with a command line interface program. Since we had been having a conversation about formulas with my girlfriend, so I made that program for her. It is not that good but I was happy when I finished my first Windows app program. I only have the exe file saved in my Google Drive and I lost the source code.
